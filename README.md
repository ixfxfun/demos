## Demo repositories

In short, if you have Node.js installed, use the `demos-npm` version. Otherwise use the plain `demos` version.

* [demos-npm](https://github.com/ixfxfun/demos-npm): Uses a typical setup of a Vite development server and NPM-maintained packages. Requires you have Node.js installed locally. Excellent editor support. Updating ixfx is easy.
* [demos](https://github.com/ixfxfun/demos): Includes a copy of ixfx, so everything is included and local. Excellent editor support. Does not require Node.js to be installed. Updating the version of ixfx is more cumbersome.
* [demos-light](https://github.com/ixfxfun/demos-light): Bits of ixfx are fetched on-demand by the browser when the sketch runs. No editor support (ie. auto-complete, help tooltips etc). Does not require Node.js to be installed. Automatically uses the latest version of ixfx.
